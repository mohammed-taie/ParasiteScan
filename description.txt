## Parasitic Infection Detection with AI

This project leverages deep learning to detect parasitic infections from microscopy images. The model is trained on a multi-class dataset of parasitic organisms, and it classifies uploaded images into specific infection categories with a high degree of accuracy. The app is built using Streamlit for easy deployment and interaction, and TensorFlow for model inference.

### Key Features:
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload microscopy images in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` formats for classification.
- **Multi-class Classification**: The model identifies the type of parasitic infection, including **Cryptosporidium cyst**, **Entamoeba histolytica**, **Giardia cyst**, **Leishmania**, and more.
- **Confidence Score**: The app provides the confidence of each prediction, along with a detailed breakdown of class probabilities.
- **Visualization**: After classification, the app displays a bar chart showing the probability of each class, helping users understand the model's confidence across different categories.

### Technologies:
- **Streamlit**: A fast and interactive web framework for building AI and machine learning applications.
- **TensorFlow**: A powerful deep learning framework used to train and run the parasitic infection classification model.
- **Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **PIL**: For image processing and resizing before input to the model.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammed-taie/streamlit-app.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Open the app in your browser and start uploading images for classification.

### Model:
The model is based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and is trained on a dataset of parasitic images. It can detect multiple parasitic infections with a high degree of accuracy. The trained model is stored in the `saved_model/` folder as `multiclass_model.h5`.
